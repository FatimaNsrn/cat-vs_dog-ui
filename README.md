# Cats vs Dogs Classifier UI

This project provides a **web-based user interface** for a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that classifies images as either **cats** or **dogs**. Users can upload an image, and the model will predict whether it's a cat or a dog, displaying the result on the webpage. The backend for this project is powered by **Flask**, which handles the prediction logic.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: CNN for image classification

## Features
- Upload an image and predict if it's a **cat** or a **dog**.
- Display the prediction result on the webpage.
- Designed for easy integration with a trained machine learning model.
